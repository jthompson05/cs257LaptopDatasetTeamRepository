Dataset gathered from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/brand-laptops-dataset

The idea behind the file "Table decomposition for group project.pdf" is make the creation of tables easier, by figuring out ways to implement 3NF (or if possible BCNF). 

While theoretically both are achievable, it was decided that the time complexity that each query would have is not worth separating the data from the dataset into more than 2 tables. 

This information about BCNF and 3NF comes to us from Conrado who is concurrently taking CS334 - Database Systems.
